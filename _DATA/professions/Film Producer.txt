Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer.[1] Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing.[2][3][4][5] During the "discovery stage", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material.[6] Then, unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter.[7]
For various reasons, producers cannot always personally supervise all of the production. As such, the main producer will appoint executive producers, line producers, or unit production managers who represent the main producer's interests.[8] Among other things, the producer has the last word on whether sounds or music have to be changed or scenes have to be cut, and they are in charge of selling the film or arranging distribution rights. The producer's role can vary significantly from project to project and based on the circumstances and funding.

Clarification of term[edit]
Whereas historically in television, the primary role of the producer was to oversee all aspects of video production, in film and often in television today, this role is filled by the line producer. The line producer may manage a film's budget and maintain a schedule. The executive producer oversees the filmmaking with regard to film financing. They liaise with the line producer and report to production companies and distributors. Whether the person is credited as "producer" or a person is credited as "executive producer" has more input on a production is not always clear and is subject to change as the film is substantiated. Since filmmaking is a dynamic process, responsibilities can grow or shift in the process and credits for producers can get adjusted retroactively. For example, somebody hired as a "line producer" might later be credited as an "executive producer".
Because of these dynamics, all involved producers must agree on production standards from the start. Negligence in that matter can lead to a domino effect.[9] Other producers are more involved with the day-to-day workings, participating in activities such as screenwriting, set design, casting, and even directing. Currently, because of the restrictions the Writers Guild of America screenwriting credit system places on writing credits, many scriptwriters are credited as "producers" instead, even though they may not engage in the responsibilities generally associated with that title. In this limited sense, the producer and the screenwriter may be the same person. Producers differ from Production Management (Production and Unit Managers and Production Coordinators) in part because the responsibilities of Production Management are more logistical than creative.
Types[edit]
Different types of producers in the industry today include (in order of seniority):
In film or video productions, the executive producer is almost always given an opportunity to comment on a rough cut, but the amount of attention paid to his/her comments is highly dependent on the overall personnel structure of the production.
Responsibilities[edit]
During the "discovery stage", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material.[6] Often, a producer must then retrieve the film rights or an option.[10] If the rights owner is worried about preserving the integrity, voice, and vision of their work, the producer might have to comply with a variety of demands concerning the screenplay, the film director, casting, or other topics.[11] Thus, it occasionally takes a lot of time and effort before the actual pre-production can begin. Late German producer Bernd Eichinger is said to have worked 15 years on convincing novelist Patrick Süskind just to agree to a film adaptation of his book Perfume.[12] However, sometimes all effort is futile. J. D. Salinger, for example, refused all film producers as long as he lived.[13]
Unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter.[7][14] If an existing script is considered flawed, they are able to order a new version or make the decision to hire a script doctor.[15][16][17] The producer also has the final say on which film director gets hired.[18][19] In some cases, they also have the last word when it comes to casting questions.[20]
For various reasons, producers cannot always personally supervise all parts of their production. For example, some producers run a company which also deals with film distribution.[21][22] Also, cast and film crew often work at different times and places, and certain films even require a second unit. Consequently, it is normal that the main producer will appoint executive producers, line producers, or unit production managers who represent the main producer's interests.[8] The executive producer for Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi was George Lucas himself, the creator of the Star Wars universe.[23]
Among other things, the producer has the last word on whether sounds or music have to be changed or scenes have to be cut. Even if the shooting has officially been finished, the producers can still demand that additional scenes be filmed. In the case of a negative test screening, producers may even demand and get an alternative film ending. This happened for example with First Blood, in which the test audience reacted very negatively to having Rambo die, so the producers re-shot a new ending.[24] Producers are also in charge of selling the film or arranging distribution rights.
Career process[edit]
There are different ways to become a film producer. Stanley Kramer started as editor and writer.[25] Other producers started as actors or directors.
Film schools offer degree courses that include film production knowledge.[26][27] Some courses are especially designed for future film producers, focusing on key topics like pitching, script development, script assessment, shooting schedule design, and budgeting.[3][6][28][29] The students can also expect practical training regarding post-production.[30]
On the occasion of announcing his own film school, L’Ecole de la Cite,[31] film producer Luc Besson admitted that at the beginning of his career, he would have appreciated the chance to attend a film school.[32]
The average annual salary for a producer in the U.S. is $109,844. If one examines just the 15,000+ producers in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the average annual salary is $138,640.[33] Producers also often have an agreement to take a percentage of the movie's sales.[33]
