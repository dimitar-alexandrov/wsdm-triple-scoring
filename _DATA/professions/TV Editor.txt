Television crew positions are derived from those of film crew, but with several differences.

Contents

Pre-production[edit]
The scenic designer collaborates with the theatre director and other members of the production design team to create an environment for the production, and then communicates details of this environment to the technical director, production manager, charge artist, and property master. Scenic designers create scale models of the scenery, artistic renderings, paint elevations, and scale construction drawings to communicate with other production staff.
Screenwriters or scenarists or scriptwriters create short or feature-length screenplays for films and television programs.
Production[edit]
Post-production[edit]
The publicist ensures the media are well aware of a project by distributing the show as a trial run or sneak preview. They issue press releases and arrange interviews with cast and crew members. They may arrange public visits to the set, or distribute media kits that contain pictures, posters, clips, shorts, trailers, and descriptions of the show.
