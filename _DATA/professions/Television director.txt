Duties[edit]
The duties of a television director vary depending on whether the production is live (as in a television news or sports television event) or recorded to film, video tape, digital video, or video server (as in a dramatic or interview production).
Primarily, the director is responsible for "calling" the broadcast, supervising the placement of professional video cameras (camera blocking), lighting equipment, microphones, props, graphics, and the overall pacing and feel of the production. In a dramatic arts production, the television director's role can be similar to a film director's, giving cues to actors and directing the camera placement and movement. In a television show composed of individual episodes, the television director's role may differ from a film director's in that he or she will usually work only on some television episodes instead of being the auteur of the entire production. In an episodic television production, the major creative control will likely reside with the television producer(s) of the show. However, the director has input, whether it be how, if, and why something can or can't be done.
Responsibilities[edit]
Other than quickly calling out commands, the television director is also expected to maintain order among the staff in the control room, on the set, and elsewhere.
A news studio might have multiple cameras and few camera movements. In a sports broadcast, the director might have 20 or 30 cameras and must continuously tell each of the camera operators what to focus on.
While the director is responsible for specific shots and other production elements, the producer (typically seated behind the director in the second row of chairs in the control room) coordinates the "big picture", including commercial breaks and the running length of the show.
